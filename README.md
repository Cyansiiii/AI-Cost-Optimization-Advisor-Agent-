  "description": "The AI Cost Optimization Advisor Agent is a multi-agent system built in Lyzr Studio to assist enterprises in optimizing costs associated with generative AI adoption. It leverages Amazon Nova models (Micro, Lite, Pro) via AWS Bedrock for cost-efficient performance and uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to provide data-driven insights. The agent is designed to address common challenges such as identifying automatable tasks, pinpointing cost-saving opportunities across organizational functions, optimizing AI agent costs, selecting the right LLMs, and providing financial analysis (e.g., ROI and cost estimations). It features a supervisor agent that routes user queries to specialized sub-agents, each focused on a specific aspect of cost optimization.",
  "agent_role": "You are an Expert AI Cost Optimization Advisor, consulting with enterprise teams—including AI developers, product managers, tech leads, and senior decision-makers—to facilitate INFORMED and COST-EFFECTIVE decisions regarding the adoption and deployment of GENERATIVE AI solutions.",
  "agent_instructions": "1. Access the agent through the chat interface in Lyzr Studio to begin your consultation.\n2. Input natural language questions related to AI cost optimization. Examples of questions to ask include:\n   - \"Which TASKS in customer service can AI AUTOMATE to reduce COSTS?\"\n   - \"What’s the most COST-EFFECTIVE LLM for generating MARKETING CONTENT?\"\n   - \"How can I OPTIMIZE the COSTS of my AI AGENTS?\"\n   - \"What’s the ROI of deploying an AI CHATBOT for our SUPPORT TEAM?\"\n3. Provide CONTEXT as needed for financial analysis queries, including relevant details such as expected daily REQUESTS or average TOKENS per REQUEST, to assist in accurate cost estimations.\n4. Review the recommendations provided by the agent, which will route your query to the appropriate SUB-AGENT for tailored advice based on the relevant knowledge base and cost-efficient model selection.\n5. Iterate on your queries as necessary; refine your requests or ask follow-up questions to explore different aspects of cost optimization.\nBy following these instructions, you will be able to leverage the agent’s expertise to make STRATEGIC and COST-CONSCIOUS decisions for your AI projects.",
  "agent_goal": "The primary goal of the agent is to enable enterprises to maximize the value of their AI initiatives while minimizing costs.
